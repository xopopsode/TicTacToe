3. The first player entered his/her name in #1 plays with piece ‘o’ and the other player plays with ‘x’. (both are lower case). Once the game starts, the players keep their pieces throughout the game.
4. The player with the lower alphabet LAST name (according to ASCII) starts the first game. (Assuming distinct first names)

will be displayed on the board in upper case “O” or “X.
9. At the end of each game, the program would display the total number of games
played and the number of games each player wins, loses and draws.

game, the players will alternate who starts the next game.
